# ITAI4374_Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my work from ITAI 4374: Neuroscience as a Model for AI. It explores how brain mechanisms like synaptic plasticity, STDP, and neuroplasticity inspire modern AI systems. Highlights include a midterm research paper on Cortical Labs’ CL1 and a legal brief defending AGI’s near-future emergence.
# Neuroscience as a Model for AI – Course Portfolio (ITAI 4374)

Welcome! This is the official portfolio for my Spring 2025 course, *Neuroscience as a Model for AI*, taken at Houston Community College.

This repository documents my journey exploring how neuroscience informs and inspires artificial intelligence. From foundational concepts like Hebbian learning to cutting-edge innovations like the Cortical Labs CL1 biological computer, each assignment showcases deep engagement with both theory and application.

## Folder Structure

- `Capstone Project` – Research on the Cortical Labs CL1 biological computer
- `Mid Term Project` – Legal brief: *The Case for AGI – Defense*
- `Module 01` – Assignment 01: A conversation between Brain and AI
- `Module 03` – Neural information processing analysis
- `Module 04` – Team assignment: Learning in the Brain vs. Machine Learning
- `Module 05` – Reflection on biologically inspired neural mechanisms
- `Module 06` – Cognitive neuroscience concept exhibit (Neuroplasticity)

## Key Concepts Explored
