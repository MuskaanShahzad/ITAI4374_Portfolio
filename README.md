# ITAI4374_Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my work from ITAI 4374: Neuroscience as a Model for AI. It explores how brain mechanisms like synaptic plasticity, STDP, and neuroplasticity inspire modern AI systems. Highlights include a midterm research paper on Cortical Labs’ CL1 and a legal brief defending AGI’s near-future emergence.
# Neuroscience as a Model for AI – Course Portfolio (ITAI 4374)

👋 Welcome! This is the official portfolio for my Spring 2025 course, *Neuroscience as a Model for AI*, taken at Houston Community College.

This repository documents my journey exploring how neuroscience informs and inspires artificial intelligence. From foundational concepts like Hebbian learning to cutting-edge innovations like the Cortical Labs CL1 biological computer, each assignment showcases deep engagement with both theory and application.
