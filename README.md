# ITAI4374_Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my work from ITAI 4374: Neuroscience as a Model for AI. It explores how brain mechanisms like synaptic plasticity, STDP, and neuroplasticity inspire modern AI systems. Highlights include a midterm research paper on Cortical Labs’ CL1 and a legal brief defending AGI’s near-future emergence.
